### compareSFC.R 
This piece of code is used to generate **Supplementary Figure 1: Comparison between Hilbert and Sweep space filling curves**.

Using several different orders/levels (4, 6, 8), it will generate a Hilbert and Sweep space-filling curve using the standard hg19 genome, colored by chromosomes. It will then run a Euclidean distance between adjacent regions in the 2D space for both SFC.
